                                <p className="leading-[150%]">This hobby of mine brewed a deeper passion to use software to impact others through products I developed. I grew curious about the 
                                        backend archiecture of websites, not just the abstracted design elements.
                                </p>
                                <p className="leading-[150%]">At 14, I built my first startup, <InteractiveLink href="https://github.com/Failure-Tech/Blaze">Blaze</InteractiveLink>, a UI toolkit dedicated
                                        to making entreprenuers focus on the core functionality of the product, not the UI. We gained over 50+ people on the waitlist, but sadly never got to fully launch.
                                </p>
                                <p className="leading-[150%]">At 15, I designed a <InteractiveLink href="https://github.com/Failure-Tech/restoration_map-1">polygon mesh rendering system to describe future agricultural growth, RestoraMap,</InteractiveLink>

                                <p className="leading-[150%]"> Later on, I co-founded Quest, a <InteractiveLink href="https://questllc.netlify.app">learning platform for competition math</InteractiveLink> as there was a gap in the market, and we gained 
                                    25k+ users and collabed with 6+ organizations (had a book written as well); and <InteractiveLink href="https://dailysat.org/">DailySat</InteractiveLink>, an SAT prep platform garnering over 80k+
                                    users and $3k+ in funding.
