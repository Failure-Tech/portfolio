                                <p className="leading-[150%]">My journey in software and building started at the age of 12 with designing my first rubix cube tutorial page. It led to around 
                                        5 daily active users and <InteractiveLink href="https://rubix-cube-tutorials.netlify.app/">skills to use for my next projects</InteractiveLink>.
                                </p>
                                <p className="leading-[150%]">This hobby of mine brewed a deeper passion to use software to impact others through products I developed. I grew curious about the 
                                        backend archiecture of websites, not just the abstracted design elements.
                                </p>
                                <p className="leading-[150%]">At 14, I built my first startup, <InteractiveLink href="https://github.com/Failure-Tech/Blaze">Blaze</InteractiveLink>, a UI toolkit dedicated
                                        to making entreprenuers focus on the core functionality of the product, not the UI. We gained over 50+ people on the waitlist, but sadly never got to fully launch.
                                </p>
                                <p className="leading-[150%]">At 15, I designed a <InteractiveLink href="https://github.com/Failure-Tech/restoration_map-1">polygon mesh rendering system to describe future agricultural growth, RestoraMap,</InteractiveLink> 
                                        using a pair of differential equations and heatmaps; a database with over 1k+ plants and 5+ iterative features.
                                </p>
                                <p className="leading-[150%]"> Later on, I co-founded Quest, a <InteractiveLink href="https://questllc.netlify.app">learning platform for competition math</InteractiveLink> as there was a gap in the market, and we gained 
                                    25k+ users and collabed with 6+ organizations (had a book written as well); and <InteractiveLink href="https://dailysat.org/">DailySat</InteractiveLink>, an SAT prep platform garnering over 80k+
                                    users and $3k+ in funding.
                                </p>
                                <p className="leading-[150%]">Now, I'm working on a stealth startup working on providing R&D Firms with readily available blueprints + software to easily manufacture products with little adjustment necessary. Have $24k+ in 
                                    potential funding and 1 contract with R&D firm.
